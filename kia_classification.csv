"Kia Seltos: Pros: 1. Pretty slick design, which stands out from the rest 2. BS6 compliant already 3. The dashboard looks good by design inside. Cons: 1. The plastic quality in lower variants is quite cheap. 2. The seats are not comfortable at all.. Front seats feel quite low on-road, while back seats miss on the thigh support. 3. Features provided in top variants for that price, feel like cosmetic changes only. With that said, I'd say that eco sport or Creta will still be your better bet, for that price range, if you prefer an overall package and not just looks.",2
"I bought Kia Seltos GTX + on 30th Aug. Till now I have driven it 1800 km. Highways, hills, village everywhere I have driven it. City mileage: 12 km per litre. Highway: 17.5 km per litre. Village: 10.5 km per litre. Overall I have got mileage of 14 km per litre. The driving experience has been exemplary. 1. Awesome features. 2. It is a beast to drive. 3. Awesome pick-up. 4. No noise at all in the cabin. 5. Excellent control. 6. All expectations fulfilled. 7. Off-roading not bad at all",5
"Kia Seltos - The only time the remote control key worked was at the time of the car delivery yesterday. Once out of the showroom it never worked again. When asked they say software problem, once updated it'll be fine. It was such an insult after buying this car. They don't even have a basic sense to check everything first and then deliver the product. Such ignorance and worst service.",1
"Kia Seltos is too overpriced and reason just some cosmetic features which don't matter much. Creta has got a better feel when driving, Creta is much smoother and has better suspensions. Kia Seltos top variants are too overpriced, looks are really good but are it worth spending so much just on looks.",1
"I bought Kia Seltos HTX+ Diesel 18.8 Lakh in Bangalore but my friend bought EcoSport Sports Edition Diesel for 14 lakh but it offers better safety features and more driving pleasure than Kia Kia Seltos. Service cost is 50% leas than SELTOS. I made a bigger mistake in my life. I realized after driving my friend's EcoSport back to back. It's really fun to drive value for Money Compact SUV. Just for 300mm length, I wasted 5 lakh of my hard-earned money. Guy's please think before making a decision.",1
"Kia Seltos is just a hype. Who wants these unending gizmos. It's a car not worth the price. Moreover, the way Kia has handled clients, booking process, brochures etc are all worst experience. Look at the cheap doors, inside lock buttons etc they're way too substandard. Better stay away from such a product.",1
"Hi, there I will tell u that what is including the Kia Seltos. It's all about Kia Seltos which is an SUV car & it's comparing with Creta. Its having 1.5 petrol engine & 1.5 diesel engine. In the diesel top variant, it's having only 2 airbags which are disappointing us but in a petrol variant, it included 6 airbag this is not a good thing they have to provide in diesel variant 6 airbags.",5
"After looking at 5 star hype on internet of Kia Seltos, today I took test drive for KIA seltos. Simply not super almost like Breeza design n same built quality. About interiors only top end has Bose Speakers other variants have normal ones. No cold glove box or light even in top end Seltos. Most of the parts are not imported and manufacture in AP that's why price is less. Diesel engine sounds like driving Tata Sumo. Test it and then decide. Now a days people are smart ""Kam daam mein acha quality"" To be frank I don't refer this seltos to anyone, 6 gears which will be definetly fuel consuming like i20.",1
Kia Seltos has good features but just in the top model and top model isn't worth spending so much. The venue gives better pricing compared to seltos. Playing with the design model wise is the biggest mistake Kia has done. Led DRL unavailable in base models to 3. Even Tyres are different. 16inch tyre only in the top model.,1
"Kia Seltos is an excellent car but interior, particularly the plastic and leather used, are not up to the mark. The dashboard and door interior plastic are not worth. It does not match with the car of 15-16 lacs. The bottle holder plastic is not at all good. Feature-wise Kia Seltos is better than any car in its variant. ",4
"Indians almost forgot what SUV means, Kia Seltos may have some premium features but lacks 4X4 or AWD. Without these features off road, riding is almost not possible. Coming to pricing it is overly priced, just by adding around 10% to the top end variant we can get true SUV like Mahindra XUV 5OO which is also a 7 seater. So I personally feel going for true SUVs like Mahindra XUV 5OO or TATA Safari, Mahindra Scorpio will be a better move. Even maintenance for Indian markers like Tata and Mahindra is more economical.",1
"The iron sheet is very thin. Seems like the company did a compromise with quality to provide the cheapest Kia. The gap between suspensions and tyres is very low so there is a high possibility of getting damaged when it passes through the Indian speed breakers. Variant distribution is not proper. What does mean to launch 8 variants? Or HT variant is useless, there should be 5 variant in GT line including diesel.",2
"I took delivery of Kia Seltos diesel automatic and before I reached home driving 15 Kms, I encountered the following issues: 1. Burning smell from hornet, 2. Oil spill over engine cover, 3. Excessive heat from front grill When I asked my dealer , he was cool enough to tell I will raise an issue with his service department. ",1
"Kia Seltos is good by design but really low on quality when compared to Creta or jeep. Jeep is way ahead on quality and that's the reason for a high price. Kia has been good on features list but doesn't include the core and premium feature like a panoramic sunroof, electronic parking brake, plastic quality, etc. Also the bodyweight or steel quality in comparison is not up to the marks.",1
"Kia Seltos is overpriced in featured variants and tech line features are not good to enjoy the vehicle. Boxy looks of the dashboard are not good, interior color combinations are not available, not luxurious interior. If we are driving near a hundred , mileage is coming down drastically. Families need sunroof for kids enjoyment and 6 airbags which are absent in techline. I feel Kia should release fully featured tech line with on-road price at 15 lakhs otherwise Kia may not be successful in India.",3
"Only top-end models have some features which too are overpriced. Also, they don't have GTX+ in automatic, that can offer all the features. Some high-end models miss ventilated seats, some miss 360 camera. They do not have a model which offers everything in spite of confusing model lineup. The top-end model currently on offer is way inferior to the competition when it comes to cost basis size & features.",1
"The things that are most fascinating and important:- 1. Performance - The Kia Seltos has a very enthusiastic approach to the driving experience. The GT line never lets you down at any cost. 2. Driving experience - Driving experience of the Kia Seltos is absolutely a segment above or two. I have driven as well as had a ride in Audi a4, Mercedes Benz GLA, CLA but surprisingly SELTOS also offer a similar experience. It feels extremely confident around corners and offers no body roll. 3. Comfort - The Kia Seltos has amazing ride quality and offers great passenger experience as well. On bumpy roads, the Kia Seltos feels extremely quiet and smooth. After these, talking about the features it has got plenty of them and mentioning them in this review would be practically impossible so I am ending this review here hope you like it.",5
Kia Seltos is good but diesel engine should be more powerful and the price is also expensive because the middle-class family can only extend their budget to 14lakh and the expensive price of cars is the reason behind the auto sector low sales auto industry should think about Indian middle-class family.,3
"Took a test drive of Kia Seltos. Car is not so great. Looks are very good but the built quality is average. Handling was not smooth. The diesel engine is not refined as it makes a lot of noise. Poor cabin insulation. Brand new show piece car window operation was making noise! Please don't go by hype. Take a test drive. Experience the product, compare with equivalent products. Check the variant you are interested & it s price. Verify is it worth or not, Then buy it. ",5
Don't just go by books and promises. I seriously doubt automatic versions of Kia Seltos as mileage claimed versus actual performance may have a huge difference. I suspect that diesel won't give more than 10-11 km/l and petrol won't go beyond 9 km/l.    ,3
"Kia Seltos is an excellent car. I have purchased HTK plus 1.5 diesel. The engine is super smooth. Light clutch, short gear shift. All needed features in the mid-range itself. Space is very good. Gives a premium feel in the interiors. No hassle next year when we change to BS6. Mileage is also very good. Overall a very good package.",5
"I saw lots of people cribbing about how Kia has come up with weak engines or price is little high, it's a mid-size SUV which competes with Creta, kicks, Duster, Ecosport with tech line of Seltos and if you want better performance you can go with gt line. I am getting 1.5-litre petrol a one above base model of 11 lakhs. It has a good engine. 5 people with their luggage can accommodate very easily. You are getting rugged looks, not like Creta soft look. The range-topping GTX+ model which now also comes in both petrol and diesel comes with feature that none of the vehicles in the current market offer Best suspension on the market. The end result is that Kia was able to bring in a very trend and highly equipped package into the Indian market and at a very good time too.",5
Kia Seltos is the best in class. A complete package for a family. Love the design and the interior design is out of the world. The driving pleasure is so comfortable. The best in the class boss audio system. It roles like a lion just too much fun riding with this machine. No doubts about the vehicle. Kia you've done a great job and helped people to choose the best one. Thank you. Team Kia,5
"Kia Seltos is one of the best and the most AWAITING SUV is set to launch at the end of August. The car looks dashing with its bold look and strong body, THANKS TO KIA. Seltos will definitely challenge the best selling cars of India such as Creta and Harrier. Seltos will be available at a reasonable price between 11-17 lakhs. People must wait for the MOST INTELLIGENT AND MOST AWAITING SUV, SELTOS, TO BRING HAPPINESS IN THEIR LIFE.",5
"Worst car ever I have experienced. Price is too much, you get better features even at a lesser price. It has the worst interior plastic quality. I myself owned the Kia Seltos HTK Plus variant. You can't drive at night the fog is putting up very fast very disappointed with this car.",1
"Kia Seltos - HTED and HTKD diesel variant have a price difference of  2 lakh whereas HTE and HTK petrol version only 50k difference for same feature difference is clear, the company are cheating on people.",1
"Kia Seltos - Making fool if you compare the base model to top model, price is almost double and looking to the current scenario we neither ignore safety nor avoid upgraded technology and in such case few better options are available.",2
"One of the most futuristic-looking cars, in my opinion, it's better than MG Hector or the Tata Harrier, Seltos gives a very punchy performance and the power delivery is very linear you just have to press the gas pedal and the rpm meter goes right up to the 5000 rpm, mark it gives an excellent performance, hats off to Kia motors. The Kia Seltos is the 3rd car in India after Hyundai Venue and MG Hector to get a connected tech called UVO meaning your voice and has 37 features. The UVO app can be used to control functions like remote engine start/ stop, door lock/ unlock, voice based commands and remote vehicle status among others. Kia has partnered with Vodafone to provide connectivity solutions along with many other tech companies like MapMyIndia and LG. Move inside the cabin and you will be taken aback by the design and layout. There are a variety of trim options right from an all-black theme to dual tone and more. The overall layout remains the same with a cockpit inspired design. The highlight, of course, is the large horizontally placed 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system that's intuitive to operate. The system adjoins the instrument cluster having a 7-inch digital display and looks modern, not only the Seltos is feature-rich, but it's also mechanically rich. Kia has added a variety of engine and gearbox options in the Seltos to cater a wide audience and growing demand of the buyers. To be precise, there are 3 engine options and four gearbox options combined to form 16 variant options. The one we drove during our first-drive review was the 1.5-litre diesel engine with an automatic gearbox. Before talking about the driving experience, here's a brief idea about the engine options. There's a 1.5-litre petrol engine developing 115 PS and 144 Nm output mated to either a 6-speed manual or a CVT gearbox. There's the 1.5-litre diesel with 115 PS and 250 Nm output mated to a 6-speed manual and 6- speed automatic unit, the one which got to drive. And lastly, the talk of the town 1.4-litre turbo petrol producing 140 PS and 242 Nm and is mated to either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed DCT. All the engines are BS-VI ready. There are 3 drive modes - Normal, Eco and Sport and three traction modes - Mud, Snow and Sand to choose from, however, there's no physical knob to easily opt between these modes. There's no all-wheel drive system either. Talking about the drive experience, the diesel engine had a minimal turbo lag with a linear delivery and a very good low-end torque. The auto gearbox responded well with the engine and it was not difficult doing three digit speeds even on narrow Goan roads. The flat-bottom steering not only felt good to hold but also had balanced feedback for city and highway driving. It was not difficult to take sharp turns, though it felt a bit heavier at times. The ride quality was fabulous and it felt like Kia had worked hard to tune suspension as per the Indian roads. We took the car through water clogged roads, broken patches and highway and the Seltos did not disappoint us. The NVH levels were refined and no diesel clutter or instant acceleration noise seeped inside the cabin. The braking was confident too, and heavy rains didn't affect the braking force much. In terms of mileage, Kia claims 16+ kilometres to a litre for both the petrol engines and 21 kmpl for the diesel engine with a manual gearbox.",5
"Most of the new and smart features given in Kia Seltos at a reasonable price. 1.smart air purifiers 2.head up display. 3.360°camera view. Massive look with all led headlamp DRLS and turn indicators. The UVO Connected car same as bluelink, it has 10.5 inches smart display with apple car play and more. Diamond cut alloy wheels. Comfortable interior with a sunroof. More smart and some basic need features are given at a reasonable price. It is a value for money product.",5
"What a wonderful Car Kia Seltos is! I drove BMW 5 series as a test drive. I was so impressed, I thought no other car can match the power of BMW. I must truly say Kia Seltos GTX+ DCT is the best of all cars. Such amazing drive with endless features. People were stopping me on the road to know about Kia Seltos. At Night it gives another beautiful feel to drive with so many beautiful fronts, back and inside. Value for money of each and every penny that has been spent.",5
"Kia Seltos is the future, Kia has added each an everything that a car needs, the cabin is comfortable and is the best thing of the car. There's nothing to dislike in the cabin it gives a luxurious feeling and the instrument cluster gives a bold, sassy look to interior and the black finish looks best. The plastic quality is also good, boot space is large enough and the most impressive thing is the look of the car it looks classy and the most important thing is the price range. A middle class gets a luxurious car and all the features in a mid-ranged SUV like 'KIA' easy to own and premium feel inside the car just loved it💜Best",5
"Worst experience with Kia Seltos, there is no drive modes in diesel automatic and not good safety features like airbags as it gives only 2 airbags in the top diesel model. Tata Harrier is giving 6 airbags.",2
Astonishing design and features. First impression of SUV is impressive. 260 touchpoint will make customer's confidence high.1.4 turbocharged version in 7 DCT must have Bose sound and 360°camera as well as ventilated front seats. Infotainment system connected with UVO and HUD is amazing features.,5
"DON'T BUY SELTOS: 1=WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. 2=COST WISE HIGH-QUALITY WISE LOW. 3=MILEAGE TOO LOW. 4=I'M BUYING A GTX 7 DCT AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION PETROL AS I HAD A LOT OF TROUBLE IN MY VEHICLE. FAULT CAN START IN BELOW MENTIONED FACTORS: 1, A.C. NOT WORKING AS WELL. 2, THE BRAKING SYSTEM IS OLDER THEN AMBASSADOR. 3, MILEAGE IS BELOW 12 KM PER LTR.",1
"Kia Seltos : Speakers are not of good quality, very low volume, running is very good, mileage awesome, smooth and easy to drive, lights are the best part, but annoyed to see the volume of speakers.",3
"I test drove Kia Seltos HTX+ 1.5L Diesel AT- simply loved the vehicle. Driving was too easy and comfortable. The noise level was nearly zero, difficult to distinguish between petrol and diesel engine by its' sound. HTX+ 1.5L Diesel is missing in some advanced features such as 360 camera, HUD and 6 air-bags vis-a-vis GTX+ variant. However, GTX+1.5L Diesel AT launched in last week and booked one. Price seemed to be a bit on the higher side for GTX+ 1.5L Diesel AT.",5
Superb looking car and future excellent color options and the interior was interesting it's better than all his segment Get it into lunch early in this year on roads dashing design super lights cubed like headlights no words to say Kia is fantastic job to create this car amazing future in India ,5
"Kia Seltos is a feature boosted car, but all the features are available in the petrol GT line 1.4 Ltr turbocharged engine and only one diesel top variant engine. They could give some of the features in lower variants also.",3
I test drove the Kia Seltos car and found it had very good in a pickup with a smooth drive. I was quite worried as I had canceled the MG Hector petrol automatic as I was not happy with the pick up and prebooked Seltos. The features are really awesome besides being smaller in size it is a great city car. The mileage also I have been told is significantly better than MG.,5
"Kia Seltos is so amazing the looks are extravagant. I just book this car and I am waiting eagerly for its delivery. The front end of the Kia Seltos is particularly impressive the huge Tiger Nose grille is Kia Seltos design trademark. The entry-level engine will be a 1.5-liter naturally aspirated petrol engine, producing 113bhp and 144Nm. The quality level of the Kia Seltos of both versions of the car that we tested are simply phenomenal. From plastics and soft-touch surfaces to digital screens and general fit-and-finish, everything is simply class-leading.",5
"I was looking for a small car as I already have a Toyota Fortuner so wanted to get a smaller version of SUV. Kia is totally a sibling of Hyundai it offers loads of features which are uncountable, above all priced at such a competitive price is the best thing done by Kia. One thing I would like to tell that rather the mg is also a good option but the headlights on the bumper like the harrier made me feel disappointed as we know that it would give great visual in night but above that we live in a country where road accidents happen quite frequently and the major part of the car damaged is the bumper we all know that and having headlight on it is a problem according to my opinion.",5
Most of the reviews for Kia Seltos are based on looks or options of features. Very few actual users. I didn't like the display which seems to be a misfit in place. The back seat could have been a bit more supportive. The reviews are seems to overrate.,3
"Kia Seltos is the car best under 20lac segment. The market-leading, best of best design and a luxury class sporty interior all makes the seltos the best car to buy, if your budget is under 20lacks. Better than the Creta. Has a very good road presence looks even better than many cars on the road and seltos will make you feel like the boss of the road. The size of the car is just perfect, means not so big or small is perfectly big. The performance is awesome. Go and take a test ride of the car you will forget all the cars, seriously. This car is going to kill all its rivals with the look of its futuristic headlamps my personal advice go for Kia Seltos. I can't even write it's features as it's a very long list but its unique features are 1. Bose 8 premium sound speakers 2. An 8.00"" head-up display 3. A Bs 6 compliant engine 4. Massive 10.25 Inch HD screen 5. A 360degree view camera. 6. Ventilated and power-adjustable seats 7. A blind view monitor. And what do you want under 20 lac?",5
Kia Seltos is a total disappointment for AMT buyers as HTX & GTX variant costs 18-18.5lakh on-road Mumbai (HTK+ variant Doesn't justify its 15lakh on-road Mumbai price tag). Better to opt for Creta AMT & save a lakh or wait for Tata harrier AMT & save some funds meanwhile.,1
Poor performance... Pickup is not satisfying numbers. The average is very low as ComPare to the company claimed... Feeling trapped with this new company. If there would b any chance then I would like to take my money back... One month's driving experience was very frustrating and trauma.,1
"Its been 15 days on Kia Seltos GTx+ Petrol, its a wonderful car with excellent features. Turbo engine picks up very fast (100 KMPH in 9-10 secs). On highways it just smoothly flies. Some of the features are really very good like when you switch on the signal to turn, you get a view of that side in your dashboard from the camera even covering blind spots.",5
"Kia Seltos is overall power-packed performance. In the era of cheap and best, it is quality and best. Many of the segment first features are alluring. The interior takes your heart away at once. The exterior is the least of your concern, as it catches your eyes from a very far away distance. The ride quality is better than Creta, and it can beat Creta in all the fields, at any givem time and at any given place. Only long term usages report may bother you, as it is quite new in the market. But it is a risk worth taking. Afterall, it is has become the most selling SUV within one month. INDIA KNOWS WHAT TO BUY.",5
"2 airbags are the minimum safety but even the top variants of HT line get the 2 airbags only, it is very disappointing. HTX+ diesel automatic whose ex-showroom price is 16lakh has only 2 airbags. This a deal-breaker for anyone looking for diesel automatic SUV. Kia provides a lot of fancy features but when it comes to essentials they lag.",1
"Kia Seltos gives huge disappointment for diesel variants, as no safety features at all compared to Price you pay to the vehicle , no hill hold, no brake assist, only two airbags, no ESC. This shocked me. Due to bad luck if something happens then there is a possibility of severe injury to your family. In short, I would go for other options from segment.",3
"Pricing for diesel is awful, the first variant difference in petrol and diesel is just 30,000 and from the second variant onwards the difference gets to Rs.1,00,000. Conclusion: just keep starting price cheap this has been done by Kia. Comparing the price of the last variant it is the most expensive car in this segment.",2
"Kia Seltos - Don't go with the hyp! Kia was crowned as a poor man's car. In India, it is showcasing as a premium car. Fit and finish is not as good as Tata harrier. Noisy cabin, cheap plastic is used. However, it deserves 3 stars for its look. In this price range, you can choose Tata harrier without having a second thought.",2
"Pros: Driving experience, Connected features like display, bose music system, Large infotainment system, Mileage. Cons: Overpriced, No panoramic sunroof for such high price, Height and width smaller than many Compact SUVs, Only two airbags for diesel top-end Variant HTX plus, No GTX variant in diesel manual.",3
"After the test drive of the manual petrol variant, I am not satisfied with the comfort and driving experience as it is very poor. The launch price is highly competitive with other best options like other brands. There is no comfort and space for the rear passengers. It's better to buy other cars.",2
"The driving experience of Seltos GT 1.4 Turbo petrol with DCT is commendable. It handles very well on highways, around corners and manages easily while overtaking in city drive. Infotainment system has got apple android car play and interface is really good compared to Hector. The quality of fit and finish is very good compared with any car even above its class. This car has got everything that a modern connected car can have plus it has demoralised the so-called premium cars that comes at double the price and much less features comparatively. UVO connect works really well whenever required with 37 connected features. The boot is large enough to keep 4 large bags. An air purifier with perfume diffuser is 1st in its segment. Overall it is a perfect car for the family as well as millennials.",5
"Kia Seltos is the best car available in the segment with bose surround speakers, 360° camera with high resolution, electronically adjustable seats, sunroof, packed up with safety feature and it also has several engine option depending on the choice of the customer and with the elegant interior option with dual-tone dashboard and more. Though sharing the same platform/engine with the Hyundai Creta. Kia Seltos feels more premium than the Hyundai Creta in every manner. I love the fast wireless charging present in the Kia Seltos and Hyundai Creta but the styling and the design of the Kia Seltos took my heart. On the outside the alloys are awesome, the all led setup is killer, the tiger inspired grill makes the car a muscular looking SUV the boxy Shape gives it a bold SUV stance at the rear the crone line connecting the lights looks dam hot and the shark fin antenna also improves the rear look of the car the Stephen is kept under neat which I intentionally do not love but is a space saver the boot is also of good capacity with 400+ liters of boot space and more.",5
"Kia Seltos is value for money SUV. Its stylish exterior and luxurious interior features added great value to it. Overall looks and design is really class in the segment. Enhanced BS 6 power of engine surprised you. Maximum care has been taken to integrate safety features like airbags and ABS etc. Certainly you will feel pleasure to have it. Undoubtedly, this car is going to become a game-changer in the Indian automobile market.",5
I had bought Kia Seltos for my daughter but it is too good that I kept it with me only. Its mileage is best for a daily user of this car. Comfortability is best than Toyota's Innova Crysta also it's stereo speakers are having very large sound my all family members loved this car because my family contains 5 members and it is 5 seater only and the trunk is also very large.,5
I booked the Kia Seltos but now I change my mood because of pricing. It's a new company & there is no comparison with MG & Harrier Because Both SUV has more space than Kia Seltos.,2
"Price bracket for Kia Seltos is too large. The base model is 9.69 and the top one is 15.99. Price of base and is cool. And specification doesn't vary too much. Only some additional features like Sunroof, alloy wheels, hud, and some other small features are different. So its a huge price gap between base and top.",1
"It looks beautiful, loaded with features, and best in price Mileage, shape, interior, exterior, comfort, safety, everything is best in this car. Many features are first in class, I think company should provide sunroof in the 2nd last top model (X). Overall it's the best car in this segment.",5
The price difference between the base model and top model is too high whereas the improvement between variants is only related to features and safety. Deciding becomes difficult whether to go for Top Model or go to the next segment car with better performance and reliability. I would suggest customers wait for new launches in 2020. ,3
"The car looks like SUV but not the real SUV. The petrol engine never makes any noise but here I can see unexpected things. IVT is lazy. Manual petrol and 1.4 is good. Diesel major looks difference from petrol even the grill and the bumper not matching with. Petrol 1.4 and diesel have all the disc brake, not the other petrol. Bose speaker is only available on the top variant. Not an offroader. BS6 fuel not available all the places few cars indicate engine issues already in diesel variant.",3
"I brought Seltos HTX one week back. This is my 6th car following Innova Crysta, XUV500, Duster, Honda City, and Dzire. I can safely say that this is the best overall car in this price range presently. This car is a near-perfect vehicle by many angles. Its design is fantastic, looks are fantastic, features are amazing, refinement is excellent, NVH levels are superb, ride quality is superb and easily comparable to my Innova Crysta. Diesel manual mileage is excellent, seat comfort is superb. The back seat of this vehicle occupies 3 people comfortably. Boot space has enough space for the luggage of five people for a short trip. I drove this vehicle on really ugly Bhokar-Nanded road of Maharashtra (bad would be a word for this road at present which I think) and I can assure you that , this vehicle has one of the best ride quality which can be easily comparable to my Innova Crysta in terms of ride quality. Seltos is breeze to drive. I drove the petrol GT line also for short distances, and it is also a great variant to own. You can go for either variant as per your needs and choice. Both variants are great. Diesel is giving me 17kmpl overall at present for 60% highway and 40% city drive with AC 100% on. I hope, mileage will definitely increase after the second service(oil change) to 19Kmpl overall. A smart air purifier with perfume diffuser is an added advantage. AC is powerful and works fantastically. In my opinion, At present, there is no competitor for Seltos, when it comes to the overall package.",5
"I own Kia Seltos since 27th August. So far the vehicle has delivered the best and fulfilled all my expectations in all type of terrain. The build quality is definitely not Volkswagen. Pickup, handling, and driveability has been great,even the highway manners have been absolutely stunning.",5
Kia Seltos is not for the Indian market. I think so but it's the price for Indian market are so relevant that's why some people are going to purchase,1
"Kia is a stunning stylishly designed Midsize SUV. At the price that it is offered, it is way better than Audi & BMW. The features offered in KIA are world class and are the latest technology. KIA has done an excellent job in making and launching its first car in the Indian market. KIA Seltos is definitely gonna be the best SUV in its class",5
"The car is not so good, the pickup and comfort zone is not good.",3
"The customer service is very poor, and the price hike was a disaster, I booked a car two months before and now they are saying me to pay more.",1
"Best car, stylish, futuristic and fantastic car. I like this car very much. It has good mileage and also has a great engine. It's tiger-nose grill is so good. It gives a bold look to the car. It's bose infotainment system is very very good. The response of the touch screen is so fast. In Seltos, Kia gives a lot of features at a very good price.",5
"I'm driving the Kia Seltos HTK+ Diesel model. Overall the car is best. I have driven it 6500kms, but still no issue. Pick up is great. Mileage is around 21kms also best on bad roads. The car is best on curve road to have great grip. Infotainment is good. Some issues with Android Auto gets disconnected within1hr. But with a software update, it will get resolved. Seats are very comfortable and backside you can have a big space after folding it.",5
Kia has debuted in the Indian car market by launching a great car. Though this car is based upon Hyundai Creta. The riding is comfortable. The styling and handling are good. The mileage could be a drawback. This is a great car. The designing and looks are fantastic. The refinement is excellent. The ride quality is superb and easily comparable to the Toyota Innova Crysta. The boot space has enough space for the luggage of five people for a short trip. ,5
"Kia Seltos is very comfortable. Nice family car, mileage is also very good. There are more advanced features like rear shade mirror, etc.",5
"Driving HKT+, value for money. Nothing is missing in interiors. Mileage on the highway is around 26-29/L, in diesel. Rear seats are spacious for three persons.",5
"Kia Seltos - Kia the name itself is enough to buy the Kia Seltos. In India, it might be a new name but globally its a well-established brand, so if you like the car don't think twice about buying Kia Seltos. There are 3 engine option, two petrol and one diesel and let me tell you whichever engine you'll pick you won't be disappointed. I had driven all the 3 engines and my pick up will be 1.4 ltr turbocharged petrol beast with 140p.s and 250n.m of torque and yes its a petrol the most powerful petrol SUV in its class and you will get both manual and automatic option(dual-clutch transmission). It's a delight. I know there are two many varients but I'll make simple for you guys. If you have a budget constraint and you want a petrol engine then you can go for htk+ it will come around up to 12.50 lacks on road depending on your city, and you will get all the necessary as well as luxury features u need. Though it's a normal 1.5 ltr petrol, if you are not a keen driver and you generally drive in the city its a very good option. Now if you ask me about diesel it is also very refined and turbo. Let me tell you all engines are BS6. So whichever engine you will choose you wont be disappointed.",4
"I took the test drive of the Kia Seltos GT model and I must say I fell in love with it. The interiors perfectly matched with the exteriors, the screen, the overall look, and features are just bliss. It's a must-have a car for the SUV lovers and trusts me you won't regret your decision given the loaded vehicle which comes at such an affordable price.",5
Kia is a new company. It has launched its new car Seltos in India. Features of the car are good. Mainly the sound and lights. And the engine's space is also good.,1
"It is the most luxurious and functional car. I had a test drive of this car, it was so silent to drive. I am impressed by the drive. And I also would like to thank the one who designed such a beautiful car.",5
I think seltos is good suv. It have nice design and nice colours engine is also good it give a powerful performance. It will be a great rivals to all others SUVs it all depends on it's price. Price is a main factor .if it's Price start from around 10 lakes then it will be a beast to others. Hope Kia starts a nice journey in India. Good luck to Kia.,5
"The most beautiful car than other companies currently in India. I don't know much about this company but this is the best car for every one because this is very powerful car and model is very nice looking and indicators are comparing with Audi and price is very suitable than other companies so please everyone should be buying this car and when it will be launched, I will buy it for sure.",5
"The car is so nice, that I don't consider it like a car, I consider it as my family member, all its features are great . The only drawback which I found is its small sunroof.",5
Good car but the problem is the parts are not available in any city that's is a very big issue.,3
"Kia seltos is having good performance, the design is awesome, good ground clearance and also comfortable seats. So the overall performance is good.",5
"Seltos all features are nice like style, comfort, solid structure attractive and familiar. And are advance features in the segment.",5
"Excellent machine to drive, comfortable ride, Enough space, cool specs, Attractive look, budgetary price in competition, Nice infotainment.Highly recommended.",5
"The Kia Seltos is one of the most eagerly anticipated launches for the year 2019. But before Kia Motors announces the price of the Seltos, we were invited to take the compact SUV for a spin around the streets of Goa.",5
"Best, but not have some features according to XUV 300 have more features than Seltos. According to price xuv300 have low.. Kia Seltos have less service XUV300 gave better than Kia Seltos. Break assist is not there and it has fewer options better than other cars.",2
"The top model in the diesel engine is too amazing. Its too silent when the car is switched off or when its turn on, it has very good sound quality, great boot space, amazing interior features, the feature of cooling, the rear seats is also great, back camera has superb quality, its very smooth no matter it is on which speed, the lights below the dashboard looks amazing, its a superb car.",5
It is an excellent car with good features. It moves smoothly on off-roads. Its suspension is also good. It gives you good mileage with the best sound system which makes your ride wonderful and makes you feel luxurious. You can buy this with closed eyes. It's the best car I have seen ever in my life.,5
"I have purchased KIA Seltos HTK Petrol last month, and I am fully satisfied with the my Seltos. The overall performance of the car is amazing in terms of driving experience, infotainment system, build and at last the mileage of Kia Seltos. I have almost driven 1700 KM and average coming 15KMPL in the city, and goes 20KMPL on highways. So, I am highly satisfied with my KIA Seltos.",5
"I think it the best SUV ever launched, value for money, attractive colors, full options and good mileage than other cars.",5
"This car is selling like hotcakes because of the hype it has created. Looks and cabin quality are good but it does not have that wow factor. It doesn't have good ride quality when compared to other cars, it is not the better option. People are not buying other cars only because of the logo.",2
"Great experience with Kia Seltos 1.5 Diesel HTK Plus. Value for money. Excellent pick-up with excellent pulling power, even in 3rd gear, will pick-up without acceleration. If anyone looking for SUV, just go for a long test drive then take decisions. I will only have the Kia Seltos. The features are also more. I drove the car non-stop for 450 KMS and gave unbelievable mileage of 26.3 KMPL with a heavy BS6 engine.",5
"The car Kia Seltos is great, love the sunroof probably you guys would like it too it gives good mileage and also the pick up is great. So everyone should actually purchase such a perfect car. All over great experience. The petrol variant is actually better. It is as silent as a hawk. Man, this is a great car, go to your nearest store and purchase Kia Seltos.",5
Kia Seltos is a beautiful car wuth nice interiors at a decent price. ,5
"Kia Seltos is a very nice car, it has good space and driving comfort. The 1.4 lit petrol engine gives a highway mileage of 17.8Kmpl.",5
"Kia motors forayed into the Indian market with a full bang on preparations and made a product which is worth applause. The driving dynamics are spot on, features are well loaded like 360* parking camera, 7 inch heads up display, ventilated seats, air purifier. You name it and Kia seltos have it. The engines are really great but the showstopper is the 1.4 T-GDI motor which is a pure gem for enthusiasts and cherry on the cake is the 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. This all doesn't even cost you much as the quality levels are fantastic too. The perfect car under 20 lakhs for these reasons!",5
"Kia Seltos is the best upmarket vehicle, basically, Kia is known for his world-class design and the material quality used is excellent. Fit-finish and the placement of the infotainment system high up in the driver's line of sight with 10.2-inch touchscreen is outstanding. Here Kia Seltos offers a powered driver's seat, ventilated front seats, ambient lighting, a 360-degree parking camera, and even an onboard air purifier are the key features which were just a dream for middle-class families or lower-order vehicles.",5
"I got GTX+ petrol manual amazing car driving experience, full of features fully loaded It's really a vehicle would satisfy you to the extreme.",5
"The car was best in driving, Comfort, and safety. Feels like premium SUV. The sports version of Kia is absolutely fantastic. The best in the feature. The interior and exterior of the car are well designs. The grill of the car looks attractive. And the best part of the car is the BOSE sound system. To be honest the best feature in the car I liked it most. The mood lighting feature is also attractive. Overall best premium SUV car. The leather seats of the car are comfortable. Knee space at the back is good also. And boot space is extra large. The good thing about the car. Engine make less noise. Even the sunroof is best. Al 360 camera looks good in the screen.",5
"Kia Seltos is pricy & feature full but not premium. Agree to many reviews on fiber quality in the interior dashboard, panoramic sunroof missing on Top End model. Beige interiors, really ??? Top-end should be all black. There are several great features and first in class but the price is sky-high. Ideally, placing top-end 30-50k below Hector was justifiable.",2
"Kia Seltos is a good car with BS6 compliant engine, good legroom, drove GT line automatic felt suspensions are a bit hard, pick up is a bit less compared to other SUV like Creta, ford eco sport and felt extra loaded features just a kind of cosmetic attraction.",3
"Kia Seltos is an amazing car with marvelous performance, hi-tech features in very attractive price. It is incomparable. Car Dekho app show each and every detail of this car which even showroom does not show us. I personally love the ventilated seat dashboard view, camera and especially bose speakers. I love that this car is based on BS 6 which is better for the environment.",5
"Kia Seltos is no doubt good, I drove it. Some of the features are in the Top model of the GT line only, which is a petrol variant. Like HOD display. Other talked-about features include air-cooled seats, Bose music system, sunroof, 360-degree camera. But one must remember more the features more will be your maintenance cost. Also, 18lacs for a 5 seater isn't worth.",1
"Kia Seltos is an excellent car but interior, particularly the plastic and leather used, are not up to the mark. The dashboard and door interior plastic are not worth. It does not match with the car of 15-16 lacs. The bottle holder plastic is not at all good. Feature-wise Kia Seltos is better than any car in its variant.",4
Kia Seltos has great exterior and interior and it is the best car in this segment which you will get at a less price.,5
"Good car, comfortable seating, well interior and great pickup.",4
Kia Seltos is an awesome car with a fabulous design and a powerful engine. Great comfortable seating and excellent ground clearance getting in this car.,5
"It's an excellent car on an amazing budget. Spacious, dashing boot space, lovely and a perfect family car.",5
"Kia Seltos looking better than next launch Car in the future, best mileage, Front & Backside very clever.Best Performance, Quality car.",5
"This is the economical car, if you buy any variant of it, you will be satisfied. Highly recommended.",5
"The car that won my heart, very spacious and comfortable...it meets all my demands. Almost very satisfied with the interior and exterior as well, provide a please of space and quite large boot space. The most important thing I like about the car is the attraction that the exterior makes and the interiors are just better than any other car in the segment.",5
"Supercar, good handling, and a very smooth driving. No engine sound to inside, a good car that I drive. Touch screen is good sensitive. Also, the steering control is so responsible. The headroom and legroom are so much. The most wonderful feature was the sound system of the car. Bose speakers are added the car so the music clarity was very well. The design and the headlight are also good. The price was so low compared to Creta and MG hector. The mood light was also so good when seeing it at night. Totally am saying KIA Seltos is the best car in SUV segments.",5
"I brought seltos htx. I can safely say that this is the best overall car in this price range at present. Seltos is near perfect vehicle by many angles. Its design is fantastic, diesel manual mileage is excellent, seat comfort is superb. The back seat of this vehicle occupies 3 people comfortably. Boot space has enough space for the luggage of five people for a short trip.it is also a great variant to own. You can go for either variant as per your needs and choice. Both variants are great. A smart air purifier with perfume diffuser .Highly recommended.",5
"This is an all-rounder car. Both exterior, as well as interior, is great.",5
"My average day run is 90-100 km and this car makes my life better and efficient, now I am driving this car from the past 3 months. It's an absolute driver's car which makes you feel energetic on the roads. ",4
"Kia Seltos is the car of the year. Its design is fantastic, features are fantastic, refinement is excellent, NVH level is Superb, ride quality is superb and diesel manual mileage is excellent, seat comfort is superb, the back seat of this vehicle occupies 3 people comfortably. The drive is really convenient in heavy traffic with automatic gear and it's easy to ride on Indian roads. Kia Seltos is a good luxury SUV at a valuable price. Extraordinary features like heartbeat DRLs and Sweeping LED indicators and All LED Headlight, build quality is excellent with attractive features in the SUV. This SUV feels more premium SUV in the segment. The alloy wheels are just very attractive. Just go for it.",5
"Excellent car in India Low budget me the high class car I love this car & my Dream car, JUST GO FOR THIS VEHICLE BLINDLY. YOU CAN PURCHASE ANY VARIANT DEPENDING UPON YOUR NEEDS, AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT, MOST OF YOU WILL BE VERY PLEASED TO OWN THIS VEHICLE. Go and purchase now This 😇 angel car Thank",5
"The price-performance ratio is better than MG, Creta and other opponents as its size and modern features are very reliable. The wireless charger is also not a common feature. Its infotainment system is of Bose which is commendable. Also, it's an affordable car of its segment.",4
"Very wonderful design and technical development are too high this type of car, and also so many features available in the vehicle, more options and more model, vehicle looking is good. I'm seen the car at road very nice and fantastic road presence, one of the my lovely car of this segment, thanks to KIA motors I'm waiting for next Carnival car, also need your finances scheme and offer for upcoming month because of India people's expected in this type of offers, Fall in Love this car, thanks for legend Kia motor, one of the day I'm seeing a wonderful day, and also provide low-level price in this market please let me know if you best in Seltos car, love you Seltos love you so much buddy.",4
"I am proud of the owner of the Kia Seltos HTK+ petrol variant, it is the most comfortable car in its segment as well as has great driving and handling characteristics. Kia has provided all the necessary features at a competitive price but I feel that it should have provided some features like armrest and charging port for rear passengers too in this particular model. Overall it is a great car and could have improved in the back seat experience at this price.",5
"The Kia Seltos is good in every possible way, but there is a huge downside to the Seltos in case of pricing, where the vehicle is manufactured in Andhrapradesh the prices must be a bit low as all the other rival are priced very less in spite of manufacturing out of India. There is one thing Kia should implement which is it should provide the essential features like 360 camera,6 airbags even in the HT line as these are essential.",3
"Fantastic tuned engine, hi-tech entertainment system, great build quality, comfortable seats and decor, first time ever air filters in the car and brilliant suspension. I have been driving Seltos HTX Diesel for 1000 km now and the car never ceases to surprise. More airbags could have helped and the rear seat could have been a bit longer for supporting the knees. Great mileage and BS 6 compliance are a bonus. For the discerning buyers, this is a competitively priced offering. Much better choice compared to MG Hector, Harrier and XUV as this is designed keeping the Indian consumer in mind. Unlike other auto manufacturers, Kia Seltos is not a copy & paste of a foreign model but a fundamentally well-designed car for Indian conditions. Thrills all the way.",4
These new entrants are not as per the safety norms. Only features and comprising on safety. People in India are not looking at safety ratings while purchasing a car like playing with life. This is well understood by these vehicle manufacturers and hence they are putting only features. I think safety should be first.,2
"NO ONE CAN FIND A BETTER SUV THAN KIA SELTOS. ITS AMAZING LOOKS AND BODY ALIGNMENT ARE SOO GOOD AND TOUGH. INTERIORS ARE BEST OF ITS CLASS. I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU TO BRING HOME KIA SELTOS AND HAVE FUN LONG TRIPS WITH YOUR FAMILY. IT'S BEST WHEN ITS COMES TO ALL-TERRAIN, SO GIVE YOUR FAMILY A PLEASURE OF RIDING A GOD OF CHARIOTS.",5
"Kia Seltos became one of the best prime SUV cars of this era in India. The car has a best-finished premium looking with ultimate build quality till now in the Indian car market. In this price range, it gives many loaded features as follows:  1. It has a 360-degree camera. 2. Both front and rear parking assistance are given. 3. Has an adequate boot space. 4. The best part is that in this price range it's also giving a ventilated seat system. 5. It has the best size of sunroof where u can enjoy your road-trip with your friends and family. 6. Now the music lover can enjoy the music with the renowned sound system company Bose. Literally I was shocked too that Kia gives the Bose sound system in it. 7. It has also many more features if you are thinking of an SUV. I would highly recommend you to go for it.",5
"The top model in the diesel engine is too amazing. Its too silent when the car is switched off or when it is turned on, it has very good sound quality, great boot space, amazing interior features, the feature of cooling, the rear seats is also great, back camera has superb quality, its very smooth no matter it is on which speed, the lights below the dashboard looks amazing, its a superb car.",5
The car looks great and we have purchased the diesel auto top-end model in which all the things are great. But illuminated keys for windows and door lock is missing. We have to search for the buttons in the dark. Overall the car is great in performance and looks.,5
KIA Seltos is completely spacious and is a smooth experience. It is worth 12 lakhs and is simply amazing. Seltos comes with a touch screen music panel and is quite good in function. Good mileage and pick up.,5
"Kia Seltos is near perfect vehicle by many angles. Its design is fantastic, looks are fantastic, the features are fantastic, refinement is excellent, NVH levels are superb, ride quality is superb and easily comparable to other cars. The mileage is excellent and the seat comfort is super.",5
"Best mileage SUV in euro 6 category, reasonable price with high end features best interior comfortable automatic transmission.",5
The engine power is not much good as expected and dissatisfied with mileage as it is showing very high on paper but that is not the reality after when you buy.,3
"I purchased the Kia Seltos HTK Plus Diesel one month back. I drove it about 3K Km in last one month. I couldn't find any single point of disappointment. With head-turning looks, everyone finds it so attractive and innovative design. I got around 16-17 Km per lit average Delhi and 21 Km on Punjab Highway. Superb pickup. Just one betterment KIA can do, that making rear seat armrest and seat reclining include in all variants. This will add comfort for rear-seat without much investment. I am very happy with the features, styling, and performance. Kia should rapidly work on accessories and spare availability to keep themselves ahead against the competition. Failing to this, Indian customer may be distracted easily by upcoming Hyundai and Fords new models.",5
"I have a Kia Seltos GTX+ DCT Petrol model and it is really fun to drive. Faced some issues while buying as Kia cannot provide the exact timelines for the car. Also, the problem is that Kia only provides 2-3 days for the payment of the car which can be hectic if it falls on the weekend. Mileage is a little low in petrol. I am getting 9.2-10 kms in Mumbai traffic. Accessories are not available with dealership and I have paid for them. The dealership said we will receive in week's time. Everything is good about the car though except 2 things: 1. Paddle shifters are not there 2. No panoramic sunroof even in top-end model.",4
"I was planning to buy a new car. Typically, SUV. I took a test drive for harrier, MG Duster, Creta... Found harrier to be overall sufficing all parameters that ""I"" expect in my car. Then, ce in kia seltos and once i test drove it, I was sold completely.. the features are top-notch ..the range of variant is annoyingly large but it helps to be picky on what u want and pay for specifics in feature department of the vehicle and choose... The appearance is great, not as good as harrier though but when you combine features, performance, availability of variants and the ride quality, it exceeds all its competition .... I have booked it and waiting for my delivery which brings the only con that I found: the availability of colours is not that good with almost all the dealers and the waiting period for vehicle allotment is way too much.",4
Kia Seltos is the best car. A great alternative to other cars in the segment. Way more feature-loaded than any other rival. Superb ride quality and handling.,5
"Kia Seltos is a superb car. With all great specs and full features, the car has everything. Just loved it. The car is amazing, it is going to be a great car for Indian people in this range.",5
"The Kia seltos is best to other cars, and the look of this car is great and the feature of the car is very important to others cars, and this car compares the other SUV cars this car performance is also very good and I saw all the version of this car is very good medium people also got this car.",5
"Kia Seltos has superb interior and great display screen. Great color options available and looks stunning as well. Its give a royal look on Indian roads. The height of the car and the ground clearance is superb for indian roads. Apart from great looks, its engine is smooth and cabin noise is super silent. In the end, a car is very unique and one of the kind.",5
"Kia Seltos has very bad quality interiors plastic, front grill is of plastic. The inner space id good, good seat comfort, and the pick up is good in petrol model.",2
"Kia Seltos is the worst car ever made, very poor plastic quality, Overpriced.  Jeep a long way ahead.",1
"Amazing driving experience by Kia Seltos, especially with the Bose, industry-leading segment ( sound system) of the car, touchscreen odometer and digital infotainment system makes the SUV value for money. Two engine options, but my personal favorite is 1.4 L turbo petrol variant. The GTK petrol version is the best version of the car. TOP features include rear ac vents, cup holders and amazing boot space given by the car to make it look top-notch. An excellent choice for Urban drivers and weekend getaways. Makes your relationship and family make a stronger bond with the sound vibe of the car. Kia Seltos is Kia's first release in India and it's truly Bad-ass,jaw-dropper.",5
I have taken a test drive of Kia Seltos diesel and it's very good. I drove it at speed of 145 kmph and really car was sturdy and very nice. Finally based on various reviews including CARDEKHO. I have taken GTX plus on last Sunday and yet to go on a long drive. Thanks to Cardekho which has helped me in purchasing my dream. ,5
Kia seltos is feature-rich but not quality rich. Quality of ride is very bad except GT model. The plastic used inside is very bad and the diesel version is having lag. Till 2500 rpm the engine is having lag. KIA is trying to impress the customers with features rather than good quality ride. Pricing is higher in the side and maintains cost will be higher inside.,1
Kia Seltos presented by Kia motors and has all the excellent features with a good engine. But the average is not good.,5
Kia Seltos is a nice car but not that SUV type feeling like Creta or Harrier. It looks like small creta pick up. ,5
Kia Seltos has given all the features that no one company has given in their car at the same price.,4
Kia Seltos has great design with great features. The car is good for Indian roads. It has good cabin management.,5
"I think Kia Seltos is the best car in its segment and sets a benchmark in its segment. It gathers amazing sales number i.e. 32000 units in just 6 weeks. It has got a very nice or say very much enthusiastic 1.4l petrol engine. It also got a 1.5l diesel and petrol models having a great amount of power and torque figures. This car also sets a benchmark in its ride and handling balance. Its steering gots nice feel and feedback and have a very compliant ride. It also gets some segment-first features like connected car tech, all led lights, air purity checker, ambient lighting, etc. It is offered in two trims GT and HT trim. The GT trim is offered in only 1.4l petrol while the HT trim is offered in both 1.5l petrol and diesel motor. I think that it is a very good move from a new company to establish its name in the Indian market.",4
Kia Seltos is a wow car. My expectation is that this thing's going to hit the SUV segment with a big impact. Now the competition has become really tough. This SUV comes with many power-packed features which are first in segment. This makes it stand out from other rivals. Only thing I doubt is about the aftersales service and all. If thats also good then this could mean a revolution.,4
Kia Seltos is one of the best in its segment to buy this beauty I liked it very much excellent car. I am gonna buy this one soon.,5
"Kia Seltos is not up to the expectations. just too many engine options, the features were exaggerated too much prior to launch.",3
"Kia Seltos is a good and comfortable car. Car is value for money. The built quality of the car is solid with a good pick up power. Very spacious car as 5 people can sit easily. Features like lights, music system, ventilated seats are just awesome. Everything in Kia Seltos is up to the mark.",5
"I would personally recommend Kia Seltos, after trying the Jeep Compass. Kia Seltos is truly amazing in performance and looks compared to MG Hector and Tata Harrier. If you want to go for a mid-size Luxurious SUV, Kia Seltos is a perfect choice.",5
"Nice car,  Kia did an outstanding job making this car reliable and most superior for Indian market it really showed the future of modern mobility with its internet features along with the worlds first built in-car air purifier. It takes the lead and it is seriously going to be trust by every Indian.",5

Kis seltos is the best car in the Indian car market. The sunroof is the best part and also the sound quality is good. Overall it is the best and stylish car.,5
"I love my new Seltos. My family bought a new Seltod 1 week before and I was amazed by seeing my car. My old family car was a 2002 Santro which we own now too. It has been 19 years since having my Santro. Getting the new Seltos was a dream come true. The looks of the car are mind-boggling, you'll love it. And the sportiness given to the car is something else. The chrome type treatment on the tiger-nose grille is superbly done. They have worked a lot on the design of the car. And Kia's first entry with Seltos is really good. The interior design was well done. The treatments on the dashboard are sportier. It's a well budget car for the price around 15lakhs on road. I suggest for those who are willing to buy a sub-4 meter car in this range. ",5
"The top variant car has all the features, I am in love with the top variant. The car has amazing safety features like airbags, ABS and EBD.",4
Nice car. I think its value for money. And for everyone because of the price range. Best car in the segment. Having lots of features in all variants.,4
"Best Car in its segment. However engine power could be improved. I think GTX and HTX are over priced. If someone has budget problem and want compact suv than he should go for HTK Petrol or HTE diesel. As per my opinion top variant should be avoided as top variant highly equpped with features but engine is less powerful. If some one has budget above 15 lakh than he should go for MG hector or Harrier because they have powerfull engines. After sale services is ok not good. Therefore, this is good package for budget car seekers. I have researched a lot on cars and finally booked HTK petrol.",4
" During the test drive time, I found all the features of the car good . Smooth engine, comfortable seats, Overall car is great.",4
Superb car with many ultimate features. The dashboard gives us an awesome royal feel. It is a complete combination of power and looks.,5

"This car is the perfect definition for an SUV, loaded with features.",5
Excellent performance car. I would like to recommend a diesel car because it gives better mileage. Kia is an awesome car manufacturer company that my honest view.,5
A very good car in its segment. In spite of such tight competition of SUVs in Indian market right now this car has achieved its spot. The looks of Seltos are very modern.

  Nice car everything is good in this car.KIA is awesome and hoping that the next car from KIA is going to be awesome ,5
"Seltos is near perfect vehicle by many angles. Its design is fantastic, looks are fantastic, features are fantastic, refinement is excellent, NVH levels are superb, ride quality is superb and easily comparable to my Innova Crysta, diesel manual mileage is excellent, seat comfort is superb. ",5
One of the best of 2019 car. I really love it and the interior is really awesome. The design of the car is really futuristic and gives an overall cool look.,5
It's a very nice car. I purchased the last two month ago. I got a very good comfortable riding and I am happy with this car.,3
I am very much interested to buy this car. perfect SUV for small families like me. KIA just made a brilliant SUV.,4
"Awesome car, great features as compared to Jeep Compass and MG Hector. Absolutely, a lovely car. Disadvantages:- 1- Suspension is not soo good, it is ok but you need to work on grip and control of the car. Advantages:- 1- Delivers ultimate mileage and has great performance.",5
The real off-road car as it can be driven in the rural areas as well. It's cost-efficient and the performance is amazing.,4
"Kia Seltos is Superb car with excellent technology. A very nice car in this segment with all the attractive features. Also, t is the most selling after lunch.",5
The stylish look of this car attracts so much to the people this car is impressive in its own way such a gangsta feeling when I see it moving in fast speed the interior of this car is so much classy This car gives you a royal feeling while driving and limbs of this car are excellent seats are also so comfortable this car in mid-range makes it attract more people so definitely buy this car!,4
"Firstly I think Creta is the best car in the mid SUV segment but when Kia launches its beast nothing other than Seltos. It crosses over every mid-range SUVs in the aspect of performance, looks, power, features, and many more features getting in this car.",5
Great build quality comfort is highest on its segment You can change lanes at 140 kmph too. It feels like a heavy car but gives confidence on the road.,5
"Seltos, in the price, is a very good car someone can get. Everything in it is pretty good but being a new company, the after-sales service that you'll get may leave you unsatisfied. Also, suspension in it is a bit on the harder side, it pumps back the vehicle and this is the only reason I've given it 4 stars because when we buy a car, with power, looks and features we tend to find comfort, which is a major reason of selecting a particular car. Yet the tyres used are too slim in such a heavy vehicle and after paying a huge amount of money. This doesn't give the feel of drive which you can get in some other vehicles in the same price range. So I'd say you can check other vehicles too if you're looking for a MUV at this range. Prolly Hector will be the best with head on head with Creta.",4
"I had driven my Seltos of around 10000 km and still, it is very smooth and fun to drive I am very happy with my decision.",5
"The interior is excellent with cam, seating, and advanced technology. The Kia Seltos also comes with ventilated seats, 2-step reclining rear seats, electric sunroof, push-button start, electrically adjustable driver's seat, auto climate control, keyless entry, and a 360-degree camera. The safety tech adds six airbags, ABS with EBD, front and rear parking sensors, ESP, hill hold control and blind view monitor. The car uses advanced high strength steel in its construction for improved safety.",5
"I tried to ignore writing a review of the car. But the quality, performance and overall comfort of the car forced me to do so. I am here writing about Kia Seltos. Using this car for a bit now with decent 10000km on record. The car will not at all disappoint you in terms of pickup and driving comfort. The seats hold you so well and on top of it the response that you get from the steering. Really impressed. I have also driven another SUV's like Creta, Nissan kicks Mahindra XUV. But Kia has really made its presence and you will feel that in every term of the car. Drove the car on hilly terrain and the motor inside it gives you that punch even if driving on a steep upward hill. No power lag nothing. It's worth buying no second thoughts to look around. Best in class.",5
Excellent car in the market. Has shaken the automobile market by its features and performance. The biggest competitor in the field of automobiles.,5
Amazing car with new technology updates and runs smoothly.,5
"In one word it's a superb car. The interior and exterior both are superb and have a good suspension. Good space, color combination is also good and look-wise it's superb. The driving experience is ultimate so far. Highly recommended.",5
"This is the most beautiful car, The design of the Kia Seltos is much richer and newer than other SUV vehicles in India, as well as being sporty. Very good quality has been used in this. Its front is a quite bold while from the side and back it looks quite premium.",5
This car is a very wonderfully design by Kia motors. Its headlights are very attractive and the front view of the car is very amazing. Kia Motors are giving the best function in this car of a 360-degree rotating parking camera with sunroof and also 6 airbags. The wooden finish in the interior of this car is very fabulous. Very luxurious sitting in the car.,5
Kia Seltos is one of the topmost good cars because of his good performance and many other excellent features at a cheap price. It is a new company which enters in Indian market but set up the best and strong market in the country we should appreciate to all to members who are working for the Kia company and thanks to designer who give this the best size shape and its rear ice cubes fog light. I love it.,5
"Poor suspension setup. Stiff suspension gives jerks even on smaller bumps. I am surprised why people ignored this. Suspension of Creta is better, best indeed.",1
The great car really with great interiors and full of new functionality which we haven't seen in any other car in India. Very much spacious and looks amazing.,5
The excellent new designs and the world's most beautiful car has already buzzed the market. ,5
Amazing car with ultimate colors.,5
"Such an Impeccable Machine with flawless drive, Indomitable power, eye-catching design, and Hushed Engine. Its a feeling of some luxury segment at very competitive pricing. Moreover Interior is just mind-blowing with such soothing acoustic sound. Pocket-friendly for all mileage concern buyers as it easily churns 18 km-22 km per liter depending on city and highway drive. Nevertheless kudos to Kia for launching such a true car in India.",5
I just bought the one but the mileage of the car is not satisfactory. It doesn't give more than 12km/ltr.,4
"Excellent SUV with modern technology, style, performance, handling, comfort. Perfect vehicle by Kia. Impressed with the long list of features including Head's up display, Air purifier, 360 camera with the blind-spot camera. Kia plays a key role in the Indian market.",5
"Kia Seltos is providing all features in under 10 lakh price range. An awesome car as compared to other cars. Mostly, getting all the safety features in this car.",4
"Kia Seltos is a very spacious car and the interiors are awesome. Very good ground clearance is very good. Seating capacity is 5, engine power is boosted. The pick up is very good. Mileage is ok.",4
I am a big fan of Kia. When I was in South Korea my brother bought a Kia optimum. When Kia launched its first car Seltos in India. I bought that. And I am very happy to buy this car. Its mileage is OMG! Very very good. The pickup is very good. It's very smooth. It looks very sharp. And it is as comfortable as a Jaguar. And successfully it is the top-selling SUV of India. And I think that Kia will give the best price to their customers. But the sunroof could be panoramic. And the boot could be electric. I think that Kia will improve its Seltos as soon as possible.,5
It comes with awesome features. Its automatic gear shifting is smooth and seats are very comfortable. All windows are also automatic. ,5
The look is best. And the interior is awesome And technology is mind-blowing by comparison to another car like MG Hector and others. The engine power of the KIA Seltos is best. And the drive is very smooth. The KIA Seltos have soo much Space for comfort setting.  And also have soo much function on the dashboard. The dashboard of the KIA Seltos is fabulous. And the music sounds quality is best.,5
Awesome car with a Bose music system. Far better than Hyundai's Creta. Great riding experience with KIA and within the budget.,4
One of the best cars in 2019 by Kia. Features in the car are amazing.,4
"Great looks and amazing transmission features. Aux, A.C., and rear parking camera are wonderful.",5
"Kia Seltos can be called as a car of gadgets. It has a handful of features but only in GT line. For HT line it has only 2 airbags even for X Plus which is the diesel top-end model. It has 17inch diamond-cut alloy wheels, 8inch heads-up display, 360° camera, blind view monitor, red color brake caliper only for GT line X plus variant. In HT line K plus variant even there is no automatic climate control. Performance-wise it comes with 1.4L turbo-charged petrol engine, 1.5L petrol and diesel engine combines with an automatic and manual gearbox for all engines. Overall Kia Seltos is best to buy GT line X plus variant.",4
"It is a nice car as it has good features in it and suitable for people who go mountain trailing. I like this car as it has sunroof and moonroof. It is comfortable and spacious with good leg rest. The outer look is very classy, till I know Kia is good brand company and has a good impression in the market.",5
I will give Kia Seltos 2 stars because of new generation technology. It still needs too many tests on the engine. Looks are good but the car is okay.,2
"This is actually the best offering in the current price range. The range-topping GTX+ model which now also comes in both Petrol and Diesel comes with features that none of the vehicles in the current market offer. 6 Airbags are standard in the GTX+ models. The suspension might not be as good as the Harrier's, but then you forget what has the suspension from the Range Rover Discovery. So in short, this is actually the best suspension in the mid-size SUV segment.",4
KIA Seltos is a very nice car with the great built quality and lots of amazing features. The driving is also very comfortable on any kind of road.,5
Good looking car and the ground clearance is sufficient as compared to other cars as it is very important for the driving experience.,4
Excellent car with good suspension and a great car for long drives. The mileage is ok for the city drive. You can buy this car with closed eyes.,5
"Excellent to drive and comfortable, features are excellent. Best in the segment. Overall, Value for money car.",5
This car is excellent in driving and features are amazing. The front of the car is very attractive and the full LED looks amazing at night.,5
Kia Seltos is one of the good specific SUV in economic range of budget. It is a more functional car compared to other cars.,4
It's a wonderful car. All features are good and you will feel like a plane. I am very satisfied with this car. It runs very smoothly without any bounces on off-roads. The driving experience is awesome.,5
It's a great car with excellent features. Looks are also awesome. All accessories are comfortable and safe.,5
"I have Kia Seltos GTX Plus in red color. It has awesome looks, superb interiors, a good loud music system and ample space.",5
"Its drive is very smooth and comfortable. The car gives very good mileage. It is best in all its rivals. Its price is best compared to other cars according to looks and features. It is among the best cars in this segment. It can be compared to other luxurious cars in India. The car is excellent for off-roading, city drives and long drives with the family.",5
"As Kia is new to India, it is taking time for sales but it is superb in performance with stunning design for Indian roads, wonderful interior and reliving mileage so its a perfect SUV.",5
"Very bold and with style, offering nice pickup, comfortable and mileage is 14 kmpl. So good SUV. Its a family SUV, so its the best. ",4
It's one of the very nicest as well as macho looking car. It's built quality and interior quality is top-notch. Must say they maintained design language not only to the exterior its interior is nicely finished and attractive. I have Diesel HTX PLUS AT Variant and I am quite happy with my purchase. It's pick-up too is not letting you feel like you are driving a 1.5ltr engine. It's BS6 compliant too.,5
"Kia Seltos is many steps ahead of tech comfort, styling, ride and handling. Though I think mileage could be a negative but who cares it's a great car. It's a premium mid SUV. Value for money is excellent. Features, comfort, space are excellent. The thing which I don't like is it does not have bold features like a panoramic sunroof and auto tailgate features like other brands.",5
Stylish and awesome SUV of 2019. The features are unbelievable. Only enjoy the drive when the car is connected.,5
"Now looking at this SUV car. It is a new generation car with a very smoothly designed interior. First looking at the interior of this car. This car has Tachometer, an Electronic trip meter which helps us to count distance we run or the distance from this place to this place which we are tripping. This car has leather seats also a leather steering that comforts us when we drive our hands to get roughed. So this car gives us a special leather steering wheel. Now we will look for the entertainment and communication, this car has 10.25-inch touch screen display which helps us to navigate, call, viewing the part behind us when we park the car, also it has connectivity for the apps Android Auto and Apple CarPlay which helps to connect your phone to the car i.e. you can handle your communication by the phone. There are 8 speakers in this car. This gives a wide range of music quality. This car really gives a good quality of music. Now as we go to the safety of this car, this car gives 6 airbags which help to save our life. This car has ABS which is Anti-lock Braking System which helps over the car to drive smooth and safe. This car has a unique feature that tells us about the tyre pressure on the driving meter. This helps us to know which tyre has low-high pressure so we can fill the air in the tyre on time and maintain the pressure of all tyres. Also, it informs us when the tyre is punctured. Also, it gives a feature of the vehicle stability control system, which helps us to monitor the vehicle. To stabilize the vehicle at a time. This car also gives us a feature of hill assist which helps us to climb a hill by a smooth and safe drive and all returning back from that hill or a mountain. Also, this car gives a 360 view camera that helps us to park safely. Now as we go to the comfort and convenience of this car, there is adjustable steering which helps us to adjust the steering as per our height and comfort. This car gives us a feature of rear AC vents which helps the back passengers who get suffocate fast. This car gives a keyless entry means we have to just put a key in our pocket and we can enter the car without touching the unlocking button of the car. As we move to the dimensions of the car, this car gives a length of 4315 MM, a width of 1800 MM and a height of 1620 MM. This car gives a boot space of 433 liters so we can put around 6 big bags. As we move to the engine, this car has a very powerful engine of 1493 CC and pick-up speed (PS) of 115 and maximum torque of 250 NM. As well as Acceleration of 11.8 (for 0-100 km). In a single word, this car is amazing. This car is WOW.",5
There is a very pleasant feeling when you just look at the all-new Kia Seltos and the feeling just doubles up when you get in the car and start driving it. The car has enough power to give you thrills on Indian roads and has good mileage in comparison to its competitors. Its interior is packed with loads and loads of features and has good quality materials used in it. The sound system is just phenomenal I just can't get words to describe the sound system. I just can't get enough words to describe this beauty. It's just mind-blowing. It takes only one drive for a person to fall in love with this car.,5
"Marvelous model available in good color with the airbags, power steering, comfortable seating, seats are so soft, chilled AC and ABS.",5
Nice but look is typical and the look of the interior is very nice The price is very high compared to other cars.,2
"The car is exemplary, well worth the price as well. The quality of the interior and exterior is also stunning. The front looks like an Evoque. The only problem with looks is that the back is not so great. The turbo petrol variant is awesome.",5
"Getting into and out of the Seltos is easy and what is sure to impress is the sheer level of quality in the interior; material quality and fit-finish are up there with pricier European cars. The dashboard is neatly laid out and usefully places the infotainment system high up and in the driver?s line of sight. Top-spec Seltos? get slick 10.2-inch touchscreens, the instrument cluster is easy to read and there?s even head-up display. A powered driver?s seat, ventilated front seats, ambient lighting, a 360-degree parking camera, and even an onboard air purifier are other features offered on the Seltos. Front seat comfort is good but the rear seat does lose some points for the somewhat lack of thigh support. While not the roomiest of SUVs for the price, the Seltos offers plenty of space and features like a retractable backrest and retractable sun visors also enhance the rear seat experience.  While we are yet to try out all engine-gearbox options on offer, we did come away very impressed with the 1.5 diesel-manual and the 1.4 turbo-petrol autos. The 115hp diesel is very refined and performance is pleasant. A slick gearbox and a well-weighted clutch also make it easy to live with. Those looking for a sporty drive will find a good match in the 140hp, 1.4 turbo-petrol. The engine is smooth, strong and very likable. Also good is the 7-speed dual-clutch auto that is responsive and quick to shift. What's missing are paddle shifters.  The Kia Seltos is easy to drive. The steering requires reasonable effort and weights up well enough at higher speeds. Ride comfort is good too with nice low-speed bump absorption and confident high-speed manners",5
Kia Seltos is the best in its class. Very good looking. Its comfort level is also good. Great driving experience. Nice SUV for family purposes.,5
"Kia Seltos is the best car in the market at that price segment and even in the SUV segment. I own one Kia Seltos .its really face turning. Kia Seltos really a beautiful car and it is just an awesome car. Kia Seltos is best in black colour in DCT petrol. Every feature of the market is captured in this car KIA Seltos almost every feature. If u thinking to buy Kia Seltos then I will say you that it is a great car to own. Kia Seltos even average is also so good. Kia Seltos has a great road presence. After the first service, there is an increase in Seltos average.",5
"Great experience with Kia Seltos It's a great experience to drive Kia Seltos. Nice drive, good road-gripping, very luxurious interior, and tremendous exterior.

The one and the only statement about it is the luxurious car in economic price. And mileage also good. So I suggest everyone have this car.",5
"It is a real car in the whole automobile industry. I not only like it but prefer to love the design. It is more premium with new features which often seem to be in more expensive German cars. Whatever the car pros and cons are but I look more about its pros. At last but not least, I am having a great smile on my face after having it in my garage.",5
"Kia Seltos is an amazing car with muscular body structure and bit more comfort inside, don't underrate the power of 1.5 diesel motor. It's the most feature-full car in its segment I didn't drive the petrol one but it is definitely a good option, the fuel economy is also decent considering its price range. Overall a good package in its segment. Finally superb model. Great design and interior. I Loved it.",5
"Kia Seltos is a very fabulous car. Its features are very excellent and good safety features, convenience, comfortable and luxurious.",5
"Kia Seltos is definitely a car worth considering if you want a compact SUV that is feature-loaded with a budget of 12-20 Lakhs. Comes with a wide range of variants. And unlike the Creta, the top end models also come with Auto Transmission. The DCT gearbox gives a very smooth ride. Also first in Class features like Air Purifier, Heads Up Display make it even more worth the price. The No. Of bookings will clearly tell you what the car is all about.",5
"Kia Seltos is a very good car and look is really great with its alloy wheels making the car attractive and very dashing, front headlight are very cool it looks like a beast. Its safety features are great, it has 6 airbags and great space inside, Kia Seltos is a very good car.",5

"Kia Seltos is a nice car, built quality is so good, good mileage, good power, the latest features, good cabin space.",5
"Kia Seltos is all in one package. Pros: great features, engine and transmission options. Cons: service cost and long term reliability is the question.",5
"Kia Seltos is a good car, mileage is also good, pickup is not good there should be internet like MG there should be more facilities like MG, overall for middle-class people, it is good, cc should be more, sunroof should be little big, speedometer should have lights like Maruti Vitara, Brezza has with 5 colours.",4
"Kia Seltos review, Design: 4/5, Interiors: 4/5, Front space: 5/5, Rear space: 3.5/5, Boot space: 4/5, Mileage: 14 in city and 20 in highway, Comfort: 4/5, Value for money: 3.5/5, Driving pleasure: 4.5/5, Has a nice feel-good factor to it.

"Kia Seltos is a very nice car, it is so comfortable car in over-all looks the cars the car is amazing and great, has got many features in this price which in general offered in cars above 40 lakhs price range. It is a great pick. My Friend took a test drive and to see him explaining the feature and driving experience was something I recall almost every day. Because of the car and the review I have started going to the driving school and will be purchasing the car pretty soon.",5
Have a stunning look from outside as well as inside. Comfortable and safety are better than compared to all other cars.. Felt in love with this car and good performance. ,5
The best Hi-tech car will be a bomb in the market the best in its segment with all latest features of future the style the exterior the interior handling all a class kia seltos will blow the car market in this affordable rate with best features loaded in this car the curves of car finish and seats are very comfortable.,5
"Perfect car for the perfect India as everyone going for creta but its better than creta in comparison to features and handling performance this is a perfect rival for all other 4 meters plus SUV. According to budget and features, htx should be the choice of variant",5
"Kia Seltos is a new mid-size SUV. I am currently loving it as it's loaded with features like sunroof, touchscreen infotainment system and many more. It has sufficient space for 5 people. The sporty and bulky looks make it more awesome. I think the price is a bit high for this car otherwise, it's worthy to buy.",5
Amazing road presence and excellent pricing strategy by Kia which entered the Indian market with a Bang. The petrol variants in the HTX series is the total value for money. Whereas the GTX variants are priced inappropriately.,4
This is an awesome car in the segment. The interior is superb. The looks are nice. The seating is comfortable. It is a spacious car. ,5
"Kia Seltos has nice dual-tone lavish interior, functional dashboard, powerful steering and many more good features.",5
"Kia has launched its first car in SUV segment that is Kia Seltos. Kia launched the car at a very competitive price of SUV segment. SUVs nowdays actually preferd in Indian auto market. Kia has completely given a good design to Seltos, after being an owner of seltos you actually do not need to make any changes like changing rear lights, tail lights and other changes. The sunroof of this car gives a luxury feel. Kia has used a premium material for its interior. Overall, it is the best car in the segment.",4
The cost of the Kia Seltos is very good and the interiors are of top-notch quality and did not feel the cheap quality. Even the base model also has good quality interior. The GT line version of the car has a very good engine and it has all the high-end features which we cannot see in its rivals. This made the seltos a very good option among its rivals in the competition.,5
"Kia Seltos is an excellent car and features are also very good. The exterior design is very awesome and important thing is a lot of variants are available. For a low end, middle end and top end all people can enjoy while buying this car. Only one thing, the waiting period is a little bit more.",5
Kia's first offering will go up against some tough competition. Our 1st look at the Kia Seltos seems to suggest it will do more than just fine in this bunch. The engine is already bs 6 compatiable and they will run perfectly in the present fuel also. The seltos is Kia's 1st made in India product. And its a prety impressive vehicle on the inside and outside.,5
"Kia Seltos is the best car, in this car you get all the features that a normal customer requires, but if you are going for higher variants then you get more luxury features but talking about base models, the car performs well. Now talking about top models you get all the luxury features which high-end users want, the sporty look of the car makes it outstanding, overall the car is good but they should do it better in pricing because 1 lakh just for the sunroof and 360 view camera is too much.",5
"Kia Seltos is the best budget car with amazing features and looks like a luxurious car. I love the inbuilt car, air purifier, headlights are also good, very comfortable car and the red colour of the car looks amazing. Kia has debuted in the Indian car market by launching a great car.",5
"Kia Seltos is the best car in the market. This car is clearly overtaken her rivals like creta, harrier, nexa . Super. Getting all the features like a led lamp, super comfort seat, led screen for media and Gps etc, adjustable steering and seats, sunroof for more luxuries feel to drive this beast. Super smooth driving experience with powerful engine etc... Getting all these features in this price range. Great deal to catch for all of you.",5
"This Kia Seltos gonna be game-changer in the automotive industry because it is gonna win the hearts of every Indian car lovers through its stylish and sporty look. And the Kia company is very known for their cars as they are stronger, trusted and performer in the automotive industry in the world. Thank you.",5
"Kia Seltos is the future, Kia has added each an everything that a car needs, the cabin is comfortable and is the best thing of the car. There's nothing to dislike in the cabin it gives a luxurious feeling and the instrument cluster gives a bold, sassy look to interior and the black finish looks best. The plastic quality is also good, boot space is large enough and the most impressive thing is the look of the car it looks classy and the most important thing is the price range. A middle class gets a luxurious car and all the features in a mid ranged SUV like 'KIA' easy to own and premium feel inside the car just loved it💜",5
Kia's first product in India is the Kia Seltos compact SUV and I get chance to drive the car. Kia Seltos comes loaded with features and there are two engine options to choose from too.very smooth and perfect engine which feels splendid to drive and its very fun to drive. Experience the neat and compact SUV.,5
I recently bought a Kia Seltos and I feel it was the best decision ever. This car exceeded all my expectations for a car in this price range. The interior quality is damn good. I picked up a diesel car and it's pretty smooth. The seats are super comfortable. There is a lot of leg space. I would recommend this car to everyone.,5
Kia Seltos is a nice car with lots of features but the 1.5-litre petrol doesn't get much of safety feature compared to the class and its a little bit pricey too. It has only 2 airbags and abs are in the top model of htx petrol. Overall it's a nice car. The comfort level and driving dynamics is much better than its cousin brother Creta.,4
"It's a competitive market, but the Kia Seltos is one of the best-looking models among its peers, and it offers up tons of interior comfort, amenities, and space. This particular three-row Kia is assuredly going to stick around for a lot longer than one model year.",5
"I own Kia Seltos since 27th August. So far the vehicle has delivered the best and fulfilled all my expectations in all type of terrain. The build quality is definitely not Volkswagen but definitely at par with creta. The pickup handling and driveability have been great,even the highway manners have been absolutely stunning. I can simply say ""I am loving it"".",5
Kia Seltos is an awesome car that everyone dreams to have. It is not just a car but it is everything you need. It's a SUV that can go on terrains and at every corner wherever you take it. It's ambitious look doesn't make it a compact too. The interior is designed so well and the engine too has the real SUV power. Every corner of this car has been taken care of. Starting from the sporty headlights and taillights to the interior lighting looks so good to see. The instrument cluster has been given a sporty touch. The wide screen display is really good as it does not involve any button nearby the screen and all the things are covered under the screen itself. I bet that you can't have such good car at such price.,5
Kia Seltos is a nice car. All the features are fantastic. The engine is powerful and has many new features. Design is nice and looking cool.,4
Kia Seltos is really worth the money & Kia has given all the top end features that we have seen only in costly high-end cars & some features are those which we have not seen in high-end cars in spite of paying such high price for those HATS OFF TO KIA SELTOS superb great.,5

"I purchased Kia Seltos on 5th of Sep, I had a Remote control issue on the next, It got corrected on the next day itself.

Kia Seltos is the best in the class car with full of features. This car is value for money.,5
"Kia Seltos is highly overpriced. The base model price of 9.7L is just to bring customers in. Higher automatic model price is double the base model price. E.g. Creta base vs top model price is higher by 60% only. Topmost model price is still not revealed, which will be even higher.",2
"Kia Seltos is the best of all choice best looks most comfortable with a row with a pair of Ac many options for costume the car it looks like a German car low price on-road and Indias first builtin air purifiers, rear Ac control and the back storage space is lot more than enough best for its price point and the looks are just incredible",5
The Kia Seltos is well turned out and what makes it really attractive is the level of detailing on the outside. There's a bejeweled look to its LED headlights and adding a dose of bling to the front is the unique LED strip that lines the top of the grille. Look closely and you'll even see a very premium knurled finish on the grille's chrome surround.,5

Kia Selto is a super car and has good mileage and good boot space.,5
Kia Seltos looks like KIng of Road. Totally satisfied with this car. Fully features loaded car it is.  ,5
Kia Seltos price is too high if the top variant can below 16 lakh then it could be no.1. car in the segment. Desperately now hector will be no1 and Tata harrier is no2 and Kia Seltos is no 3 position.,1
Kia Seltos is a very good car with good design. Features of the car made it more comfortable. Car is avilable at an affordable price that a middle class family can buy it. This is my dream car.,5

If price 10lac its best mileage and cheap and best quality car presently in India battery charging decrease the pollution.,5
"Kia Seltos has an awesome design, honestly speaking It has the most amazing looks ever.",5
It overcomes all the negative points from other cars. It Beats creta with Masculine and bold looks. It beats Jeep compass with the price and automatic options.

Kia Seltos is a good car. The looks are amazing. The features are nice. ,4
"Based on my onscreen review, one of the best SUV to hit the market with its maiden entry into the Indian market. As the images and video reveals it has everything that Creta lacks as far as exterior design is concerned especially the rear view. A big but well designed SUV Seltos touches deep to my heart with marvelous front, beating the MG Hector, heart touching rear beating the Hyundai Creta and the boot space, ground clearance, length, breadth, height, and power is almost same as that of XUV500, MG Hector and Tata Harrier. But it is the pricing that matters in the Indian market. Price it properly to avoid the undesired results as it happened in case of Jeep Compass. Trust me the Indians will compromise with safety features but not with design and pricing. Believe me, this SUV is going to rock the market with the sporty design but pricing that worries me. Don't forget what is happening to Jeep Compass as it is priced beyond the buyer's expectations. In the end best of luck to Kia, a sister company of Hyundai to compete not only with its brother Hyundai but also with all the SUVs currently available in the Indian market.",4
"Everything is just marvellous about this SUV... will capture the market in 2yrs. The exterior is looking compact and stylish.. a fresh feel is there in comparison to Creta which the people have become used to. Kia has done well not going for bigger size like harrier or hector which should make it more fun to drive and economic. Interiors, and features are simply best in the class.",5
Kia Seltos must be the revolutionary company in the Indian automobile market.,5
This is a nice car. The features are amazing. The looks are great. ,5
"It's going to launch with amazing features, and with a muscular sporty look. It will definitely work well on the Indian Market. If you're planning to buy a compact SUV like Creta or duster.

Kia is an affordable product for SUV lovers. If we are comparing Kia Seltos or Creta so Kia will definitely wins this segment.,4

The car has three engine options all of them available either in manual or automatic transmissions. The car is BS6 compliant and Kia has nailed it with the design and features.

Most popular car in the world because of looks. Its look is very good and has many features that contain In-car 50-liter storage to fill tanks and many features. This car drives smoothly and this car is best for buying.,5
"New in the Indian market, Kia Seltos is everything that one needs in a mid-size SUV. Value for money, indeed.",4
"Good car with the futuristic and latest tech, appealing to masses especially gen x,y, and z. Looks sturdy, has road presence and a differentiator when runs on the road, a masculine look which is attracting most of the young people. Multiple variants and both manual and auto transmission options make it a top seller. The only area where it needs to work on is the mileage, which is not at its best compared to other vehicles available competing with Seltos. Mileage is 8-10 which is slightly on the lower side. Ride quality is excellent with very low engine noise. Good torque and control at high speeds and turns.",4
"It's a good looking car, nice performance, comfort level is good and luxurious. The interior is very attractive and of good quality.",4
"Very good car in budget with the best performance, low maintenance and undoubtedly controlling is also very well.",5
"A very good car, in this price tag they gave all premium interiors but the only thing petrol DCT transmission heats up.",4
"If we talk about the overall ratings of Seltos, no one can give a proper review. When I started the engine, the sound was so negligible that I cannot tell you the silence in the cabin. The power to thrust ratio is well explained in this Car. Even if you scale at 3rd gear. The engine seems to be smooth and amazing. I would suggest Seltos over The Hector and the Harrier.",5
"The car is great at handling and suspension is set good for the Indian roads. Good design in exterior as well as interior, The engine shows good aggressiveness in the real world. Offroad experience is good too because of the suspension and the projector headlights. The space that the car offers in the second row and in the boot is pretty good. The car looks great in the outer world.",4
Seltos is a big hit in India. Kia released their first car and got a massive hike. The horsepower and 1-liter turbo charge is just lit. It became the fourth largest car producing companies in India already. The screen in the car is just awesome and should've got panoramic sunroof competing for the MG Hector. The speed is pretty good.,5
The best car in the segment and is quite affordable.,4
Great design and silent cabin with good ground clearance. Comfortable to drive for longer travel.,4
I had a test drive and the performance and comfort were good. The riding position should have been better.,4
This car is unbelievable due to its features and looks it has.,5
Best experience with new Kia. Fully loaded with Hi-Tech features. Enjoying the drive as this is the most amazing car ever.,4
A fabulous car which is very much extra-ordinary.,3
"This is actually the best offering in the current price range. People have been cribbing about features, well then pay for it! You forget it's technically not an Indian company, so taxes are more! The range-topping GTX+ model which now also comes in both petrol and diesel comes with features that none of the vehicles in the current market offer. 6 Airbags are standard in the GTX+ models. As is ABS and EBD! The suspension might not be as good as the Harrier's, but then you forget what has the suspension from the Range Rover Discovery. So in short, this is actually the best suspension in the mid-size SUV segment. At 20.5 lakhs (on-road TN) for the ranging topping editions, this automobile is pretty much the best that you can get. Servicing might be an issue for now. But if Hyundai is able to provide support in any way, I believe KIA will never let us down in that regard either. The end result is that KIA was able to bring in a very trendy and highly-equipped package into the Indian market, and at a very good time too!",5
Really an amazing car and a very smooth car.,5
The Kia Seltos is a bit more expensive but offers a lot more for it in terms of safety and features. It is well worth the premium over the MG Hector,5
The most beautiful car than other companies currently in India. I don't know much about this company but this is the best car for everyone because this is a very powerful car and the model is very nice looking and indicators are comparing with Audi and the price is very suitable than other companies.,5
The Kia Seltos is very excellent in looks. Its alloy wheel looks great and the front fog lamps and big headlights with DRLs looks are pretty much fascinating. This mid-size SUV is too good in this range. Kia Seltos is better than MG Hector and Hyundai Creta. Kia Seltos's front view is looking aggressive and side view of Seltos is just amazing.,5
It looks very different as it has a sunroof and is a five-seater car. The boot space is also bigger than other cars.,5

The vehicle drives very smooth and you can get very attached and comfortable within its first 5 seconds of the drive. Interior is refreshing, the led wall is a gem. Smooth drive brings you comfort. Looks are damn good and appealing. Best selling vehicle in this segment. A Perfect Masterpiece debut.",5
"Excellent Features and at par with luxury cars like BMW and Benz etc. I was using Ford Ecosport which was much stronger than Kia Seltos. Transmission temperature increases and you are forced to stop in traffic. Except for the strength and heaviness of the car, looks-wise It is very elegant.",4
"Looking nice and has a good performance as well. One of the best SUV of the current time, autonomous and voice control are amazing.",5

"Amazing driving experience being a cousin of Hyundai, Kia gives more money value but MG has better space and features.",4
"Amazing features, excellent road presence with safety features and comfort within the budget.",5
"The car looks amazing, The DRL's are attractive and the touch screen display has a really good response; but the car couldn't get 5 stars as the speedometer and the touch display could be more stunning which would upgrade the interior to a whole another level; Even though the dual-tone interior is interesting. The design of the car will stand out amongst the competitors like MG Hector, Hyundai venue, etc. Overall performance of the car is a bang for the buck!",4

But since the very first day, I noticed a very annoying sound coming from rear of the vehicle. I have tried all possible things like removing all lose attachments and items from the car but the annoying sound still persists. This sound comes when the vehicle passed over the uneven road. I tried to identify the issue and I felt I have been able to locate the source. I request Kia to help me resolve this as this is really spoiling the driving experience and feel that this can be resolved with proper technical support.",5

One of the best SUV sub 20L to have been launched in 2019. The top of the range GT has got all the tech and gadgets you can expect in an international model. If you compare it to any other SUV in its class its got the most bang for the buck and KIA has so many varients the price starts from 11L. So people from different walks of life can afford to buy a world-class car. Drive and handles great plenty of space for a family of 5 and one of my favourite cars in 2019.,5
"Fully feature loaded car, best car I have experienced with a different design in the SUV segment, it gives a tough performance to other SUV cars like hyundai Creta, Tata Harrier and MG Hector and the best feature I saw in this segment is the heads up display, four disc brakes and smart air purifier which provides different fragnances with settings to change the fragnance.",5

It has a good interior structure we can't get throughout for any reason.,5
"It is a very luxurious car at a very less price. It is very comfortable and very easy to drive around the city and very effortless. Also, I travel a lot with it and it seems fun. The music system is also creative and has good bass to it so that we can drive the car with pleasure and joy.",5
"Kia Seltos Diesel is best in class. Cabin noise cancellation and no turbo lag at all, unlike other Diesel cars. Look wise it beats every other car in its segment, it is designed very carefully to give it a touch of premium luxury cars. Bose sound system works awesome and its icing on the cake.",5

"I am glad that I have this SUV. It is very good and comfortable, spacious also. It is extremely good and wonderful.

One of the great things of this car has been the roof, it is very pleasing to have a view of the outside when the see-through glasses is almost edged to edge. Build quality has also been pretty solid. It suits well for Indian roads - this makes below par road quality feel like a toast with so butter applied on it! One of the key lookouts would be the accessibility of the available parts across the country. Given the time I am hoping it would grow rapidly!",4

Size itna bada nahi hai or na hi chota hai or agar wheels ki baat kare to style sabse alag hai matlab aisa design hai jo time beetne ke baad bhi old nahi dikhega.,4

People had no option and they had to go for Creta (Majburi). People who own Creta very well know that Kia Seltos is far ahead of them.

Hope you enjoyed my review thank you.",5
"Kia Seltos is the best ever SUV / MPV car with all the safety features and latest technology in the market in the budget of every middle-class family.
